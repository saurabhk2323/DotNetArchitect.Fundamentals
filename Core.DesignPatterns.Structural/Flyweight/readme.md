🧠 What Is the Flyweight Pattern?
The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

🧭 When to Use It (Architect's View)
You have a very large number of objects at runtime (e.g., millions of Product entries).

Many of these objects share common, immutable data.

You want to externalize and reuse the shared state to optimize memory/performance.

🎯 Real Use Case 1: Product Catalog
Problem:
You have a web app that lists:

10,000+ Product items.

Each item has:

Name, Price (unique per item)

Brand, Category, Warranty Terms (shared by thousands of items)

👉 You don’t want to store the same brand/category string 10,000 times.

✅ Flyweight Solution:
Move shared fields (Brand, Category, Warranty) into a ProductFlyweight class.

Store them in a central factory that reuses existing flyweights.

----------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Use Case 2: Notification Template Flyweight
Imagine you have:

Thousands of notifications sent daily

Most notifications share:

A template (e.g., Order Confirmation)

A language

A channel

Rather than creating new template objects each time, you use Flyweight to share them.

----------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Architectural Thinking: What is Intrinsic vs Extrinsic?
Intrinsic (shared)	Extrinsic (external/dynamic)
Brand, Category, Warranty	Product Name, Price
Notification Template & Channel	Recipient, Timestamp, Dynamic message
Order Status Messages	Actual Order ID or Line Item Total

📋 Notebook Summary
Aspect					Notes
Pattern					Flyweight
Purpose					Reduce memory usage by sharing common object state
Key Terms				Intrinsic (shared), Extrinsic (passed-in)
Factory Role			Centralized flyweight object pool
Domain Examples			Product Catalog, Notification Templates, Order Items
Benefit					Memory efficiency at scale
Interview Line			“Used Flyweight in a product catalog to avoid redundant brand/category metadata and improve performance while rendering thousands of items.”

✅ Interview-Ready Narration
“In our product microservice, we needed to render thousands of product cards in the UI. Most of them had the same brand and category. 
So we applied the Flyweight pattern: extracted shared fields into a ProductFlyweight and used a factory to manage them. 
This let us reuse memory-heavy metadata, improving performance especially in high-volume scenarios.”

----------------------------------------------------------------

🧱 Database Analogy
Let’s apply this to your domain — OrderItem and Product:

🧩 Intrinsic (Shared) Data
Stored once in a ProductMetadata table:

ProductTypeID (PK)	Brand	Category	Warranty	Specs
101	Apple	Laptop	1 Year	M2 Chip
102	Dell	Laptop	2 Years	i7, 16 GB

🧩 Extrinsic (Dynamic) Data
Stored in OrderItem table:

OrderItemID	ProductName	Price	ProductTypeID (FK)
1	MacBook Air M2	₹120000	101
2	MacBook Pro M2	₹180000	101
3	Dell Inspiron 15	₹70000	102

👉 So yes: Each OrderItem references a ProductMetadata — just like a Flyweight.

🔄 Retrieving Order Details (Two Tables Join)
When you need to view a complete order, your query joins both:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    o.ProductName,
    o.Price,
    p.Brand,
    p.Category,
    p.Warranty
FROM OrderItem o
JOIN ProductMetadata p
    ON o.ProductTypeID = p.ProductTypeID
WHERE o.OrderItemID = 1;
You get:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"MacBook Air M2", ₹120000, "Apple", "Laptop", "1 Year"
🤖 In Application Code (Flyweight Logic)
Your OrderItem domain object might look like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class OrderItem
{
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public ProductFlyweight ProductInfo { get; set; } // shared metadata
}
The ProductFlyweight is loaded either:

At service startup and cached in memory (FlyweightFactory)

Or lazy-loaded when accessed

🧠 When This Becomes Powerful
You cache metadata (ProductFlyweight) — maybe even from Redis

You keep your OrderItem table lean (no duplication of brand/category/warranty/etc.)

You decouple volatile info (like price or stock) from static info (like brand/warranty)

✅ So, to your original question:
"To fetch an order, will we query two tables?"

✔️ Yes, absolutely — and that's good design:
Query Design	Reason
Join two tables	Normalize memory-heavy data, avoid redundancy
Lookup flyweight keys	Cache in-memory, fewer DB hits
Use with ORM (EF Core)	Yes, with navigation properties and eager/lazy loading

🧠 Bonus: Applying in Notification System
For NotificationTemplate:

TemplateID	Title	Language	Channel
1	Order Confirmed	en-US	Email
2	Payment Failed	en-US	SMS

NotificationLog (Extrinsic):

LogID	UserID	Timestamp	TemplateID (FK)	Custom Data (JSON)

🔁 Again: Your service combines flyweight metadata + runtime data for final output.

✅ Final Thought
Think of Flyweight not just as a memory pattern — but as a principle of reference-based reuse.

In enterprise systems, this means designing lookup tables, normalized reference data, and shared caches across large volumes.
